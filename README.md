## About sparse-to-dense depth completion <a name="about-sparse-to-dense"></a>
In the sparse-to-dense depth completion problem, we seek to infer the dense depth map of a 3-D scene using an RGB image and its associated sparse depth measurements in the form of a sparse depth map, obtained either from computational methods such as SfM (Strcuture-from-Motion) or active sensors such as lidar or structured light sensors.

## About VOICED <a name="about-voiced"></a>
VOICED is an unsupervised depth completion method that is built on top of [XIVO][xivo_github]. Unlike previous methods, we build a scaffolding of the scene using the sparse depth measurements (~5% density for outdoors driving scenarios like KITTI and ~0.5% to ~0.05% for indoors scenes like VOID) and refines the scaffolding using a light-weight network.

</p>

This paradigm allows us to achieve the state-of-the-art on the unsupervised depth completion task while reducing parameters by as much as 80% compared to prior-arts. As an added bonus, our approach does not require top of the line GPUs (e.g. Tesla V100, Titan V) and can be deployed on much cheaper hardware.

## Setting up your virtual environment <a name="setting-up"></a>
We will create a virtual environment with the necessary dependencies
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 voiced-py3env
source voiced-py3env/bin/activate
pip install opencv-python scipy scikit-learn Pillow matplotlib gdown
pip install numpy==1.16.4 gast==0.2.2
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14
```

## Setting up your datasets
For datasets, we will use KITTI for outdoors and VOID for indoors
```
mkdir data
bash bash/setup_dataset_kitti.sh
bash bash/setup_dataset_void.sh
```

The bash script downloads the VOID dataset using gdown. However, gdown intermittently fails. As a workaround, you may download them via:
```
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GGov8MaBKCEcJEXxY8qrh8Ldt2mErtWs
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c3PxnOE0N8tgkvTgPbnUZXS6ekv7pd80
https://drive.google.com/open?id=14PdJggr2PVJ6uArm9IWlhSHO2y3Q658v
```
which will give you three files `void_150.zip`, `void_500.zip`, `void_1500.zip`.

Assuming you are in the root of the repository, to construct the same dataset structure as the setup script above:
```
mkdir void_release
unzip -o void_150.zip -d void_release/
unzip -o void_500.zip -d void_release/
unzip -o void_1500.zip -d void_release/
bash bash/setup_dataset_void.sh unpack-only
```

For more detailed instructions on downloading and using VOID and obtaining the raw rosbags, you may visit the [VOID][void_github] dataset webpage.

## Training VOICED <a name="training-voiced"></a>
To train VOICED on the KITTI dataset, you may run
```
sh bash/train_voiced_kitti.sh
```

To train VOICED on the VOID datasets, you may run
```
sh bash/train_voiced_void.sh
```

To monitor your training progress, you may use Tensorboard
```
tensorboard --logdir trained_models/<model_name>
```

## Downloading our pretrained models <a name="downloading-pretrained-models"></a>
To use our KITTI and VOID models, you can download
```
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18jr9l1YvxDUzqAa_S-LYTdfi6zN1OEE9
unzip pretrained_models.zip
```

Note: `gdown` fails intermittently and complains about permission. If that happens, you may also download the models via:
```
https://drive.google.com/open?id=18jr9l1YvxDUzqAa_S-LYTdfi6zN1OEE9
```

We note that the [VOID][void_github] dataset has been improved (size increased from ~40K to ~47K frames) since this work was published in RA-L and ICRA 2020. We thank the individuals who reached out and gave their feedback. Hence, to reflect the changes, we retrained our model on VOID. We achieve slightly better performance than the reported numbers in the paper.

| Model            | MAE   | RMSE   | iMAE  | iRMSE  |
| :--------------- | :---: | :----: | :---: | :----: |
| VGG11 from paper | 85.05 | 169.79 | 48.92 | 104.02 |
| VGG11 retrained  | 82.27 | 141.99 | 49.23 | 99.67  |

To achieve the results, we trained for 20 epochs and use a starting learning rate of 5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> up to the 12th epoch, then 2.5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for 4 epochs, and 1.2 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for the remaining 4 epochs. The weight for smoothness (w<sub>sm</sub>) is changed to 0.15. This is reflected in the `train_voiced_void.sh` bash script.

## Evaluating VOICED <a name="evaluating-voiced"></a>
To evaluate the pretrained VOICED on the KITTI dataset, you may run
```
sh bash/evaluate_voiced_kitti.sh
```

To evaluate the pretrained VOICED on the VOID dataset, you may run
```
sh bash/evaluate_voiced_void.sh
```

You may replace the restore_path and output_path arguments to evaluate your own checkpoints
